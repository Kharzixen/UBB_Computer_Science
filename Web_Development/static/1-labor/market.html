                                            Audi introduced a revised A4 in late 2004, with the internal designation of B7. Although given a new platform designation, the B7 was essentially a heavily facelifted and revised version of the B6, with revised steering settings, suspension geometry,[specify] new internal combustion engine ranges, navigation systems and chassis electronics (including a new advanced Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) system). The front grille assembly changed to a tall trapezoidal shape in the same manner as the C6 (third-generation) Audi A6; however, 
                                            the dashboard and interior were virtually unchanged from the B6 aside from minor detailing.

It is heavily influenced by the Audi A8 (D4), pulling elements from its exterior details.[39][40] The A6 shares its interior, platform, and powertrain (Modular Longitudinal Platform) with the Audi A7 four door sedan, which had been released shortly before also in 2011. Compared to the A8 and A7, the A6 has the most aggressive front fascia and LED headlights (optional full LED headlamps). 
                                            Design work began in 2006, with Jurgen Loffler's exterior design being chosen in 2008.[41]

The A6 will be offered in 7 new exterior colors and 7 colors which are available in current models.[86]
